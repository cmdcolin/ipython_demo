## Quick-start Tutorial

Here we will start with some basic steps to start you down the road
for becoming a developer!


First we will create a github account
Then we will make a fork of this repo

    git clone https://github.com/yourname/ipython\_demo.git

You can try changing the text of this README, then running

    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Updated README"
    git push

If all goes well, this will be pushed to your repo!

## IPython demo

To test out the IPython notebook functions in github, we will look at
the recent news about this nice synergy.

https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3



    pip install ipython[notebook]
    pip install matplotlib
    ipython notebook


This will launch a web-based based jupyter shell.

Notes: see note about installing matplotlib
http://matplotlib.org/faq/installing\_faq.html#install-osx-binaries

Note that I recommend homebrew's python since I received "Python.h not
found errors otherwise"
